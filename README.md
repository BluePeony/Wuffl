# Wuffl
# 1. Introduction
Wuffl is a simple image viewer which can move pictures either to a so called „pictureshow“ folder or to a „delete“ folder. Pictureshow and delete folders are located in the same folder as the chosen picture. Wuffl is available for Linux Ubuntu 14.04 and higher and Windows10.  

Imagine you review you vacation pictures and you need to select which pictures to show to your parents at the next family dinner or you work your way through a bunch of old pictures and you need to select a view for a anniversary celebration. Using a common image viewer you'll probably write down the names of the chosen pictures, then carefully select the pictures by the names you just wrote down, copy and then paste them in a new folder. At least that's the way I used to do it. Since it was a little bit annoying I came up with a new simple image viewer which helps you to move the picture to an extra folder (pictureshow folder) or to a delete folder.
